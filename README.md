# CODLauncher

Simple launcher for various COD clients.
Supports the following clients:
- T4, T5, T6 and IW5-mp for Plutonium
- IW4, IW5-sp, IW6 and S1 for AlterWare
- h2-mod
- ezboiii

You'll need to provide the paths for each game you have installed individually. 

- For Plutonium, provide the path to the folder in %localappdata%. (it contains a bin and games folder)
- For Alterware, provide a directory containing the alterware-launcher.exe
- For ezboiii and h2-mod, drop the client executables in the corresponding game folders.
  
All games must be legally owned on steam for this launcher to work. Cracked copies will __not__ work.
